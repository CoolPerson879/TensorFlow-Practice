# TensorFlow-Practice

This is a collection of some of my data-science related projects I have been working on over the last few months

## Files

### Heart_Disease_Prediction_Model.ipynb
A notebook for predicting heart disease, using TensorFlow and Keras to predict whether a patient does or does not show signs of heart disease.

### Medical_Insurance.ipynb
A notebook analyzing medical insurance data, using linear regression to predict health insurance prices

### NeuralNetworkClassification.ipynb
A notebook implementing neural network classification models.

### Pi.ipynb
A notebook that uses python and mathematical formulas to approximate the value of $\pi$, approximating up to 7,000 digits. The approximations made in this notebook were used to extrapolate dta in the `PiExtrapolation.ipynb` file

### PiExtrapolation.ipynb
A notebook focused on finding patterns in the first 7000 digits of pi, approximated with the formula from `pi.ipynb`

### PizzaOrSteak.ipynb
A notebook for image classification distinguishing between pizza and steak images, I learned how to use and develop conveluional neural network models and apply machine learning models on images.
